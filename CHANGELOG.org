* Changes 
** 0.4.0
- Sente: Add options to component before wrapping, https://github.com/danielsz/system/pull/92/files
- Alex Millerâ€™s bad namespace form. https://github.com/danielsz/system/pull/93 & https://github.com/danielsz/system/pull/94 
- Regression fix. https://github.com/danielsz/system/issues/96
- Parameter validations (auto and files, regexes and paths).
- Hara Watcher idempotency https://github.com/danielsz/system/pull/99
- Hara Watcher monitoring
- Removed data_readers loading, since it is built-in the boot-repl task
- Added modes to run system.boot in standard (Lisp) mode, no unloading (no remove-ns), or default tools.namespace mode (with remove-ns)
- Etsy component: removed extraneous field
- Removed dependencies from the dev profile in favor of test profile  https://github.com/danielsz/system/issues/102
- New Konserve component
- Duct abstractions: enhancements

    - Endpoints can specify middleware
    - Routes will be recombined according to their middleware
    - The Handler component can also specify middleware that will be applied to all endpoints/routes

    This allows to address the use case when different routes need
    different middleware. For example, Sente is incompatible with
    `wrap-restful-format'.

    https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente/issues/123

    Decomplecting routes and middleware also enables better
    composition. Side-effectful middleware, such as wrap-params, consumes
    the request body upon reading it. This means it should only be applied
    once. Hence, web-centric libraries should never force such middleware
    on the user, but rather let him apply any middleware needed on
    recombined routes in the end application.

    https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-defaults/issues/10

    With our new implementation, it is possible to write libraries, for
    example a social sign-in library, keep it totally separate from
    application code, and then, with the Duct abstractions in `system',
    compose endpoints with any middleware the application should need.

    Middleware: https://github.com/danielsz/system/issues/48 

    New, simplified middleware component. Receives a vector of
    functions or vectors. If vector is specified, apply first item in
    vector to handler and rest of vector items (middleware arguments).
    This is a breaking change (only for the middeware component).

    Middleware plays well in the dependency injection mechanism of Component. 
    To wrap the component in middleware, use :component keyword (convention).

- Carmine/Redis PubSub (pattern channels)
- hara.io.scheduler 
- Allow regex and paths in files vector (https://github.com/danielsz/system/pull/86)

- Print output when system starts and stops (@peterromfeldhk)
- Validate sys. https://github.com/danielsz/system/issues/91
** 0.3.0
This is a breaking change release
- Incorporates Duct abstractions (endpoint and handlers)
- App component is deprecated
- Revised the reloading mechanism. Leveraging tools.namespace. New option enabling to turn unloading on or off.
- `reloaded.repl` is now `system.repl`
- Validation with prismatic/schema
- New example for system + sente
- Mongo component supports options, credentials
- Adi component added
- Hikari component added
- JDBC component made idempotent
- Jetty made idempotent
- Test selectors
- Monitoring (protocol and various implementations)
** 0.2.1
- Fixes a long-standing issue with *data-readers* in Boot: https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/issues/47
- Release Datomic connection upon stop. https://github.com/danielsz/system/pull/46  
** 0.2.0
- Dependencies: clojure 1.7.0, sente 1.6.0
- Cider nREPL component
- Neo4j component
- Quartzite component 
- ScheduledExecutorService component
- Immutant web service component
- Closures are used to expose resources to http requests instead of merging it in the request map (App component)
- Web components (jetty, immutant, http-kit) can be passed functions, but also components.  Yes, even arbitrary user-defined components, as long as the convention is respected, namely that (:app my-custom-component) returns a web handler.
- Mongo component can be initialized with a function (typical use case: indices) that receives the db as argument
** 0.1.9
- Generic app component for typical Ring applications
- Web service example
- Postgres component
- Latest dependencies: component, ns-tracker.
- http-kit acces to full options
- EPL License
** 0.1.8
- switch to enable hot-reloadable system
- file-based granularity to only restart the system when user-specified files change.
- auto-start option.
- New ElasticSearch component
** 0.1.7
- Example of a task to run a dev system on the command line (versus REPL).
- ~run~ boot task is not built-in. So it now ships with ~system~.
** 0.1.6
- Latest Sente version. This is a breaking change for Sente.
** 0.1.5
- Added example project for the Boot build tool.
- Added boot task to reload namespaces on file changes.
