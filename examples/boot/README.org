* Example project

** What is this?
This project gives you an overview of how you might want to structure a Clojure web app with the [[https://github.com/danielsz/system/][system]] library.
The example project starts a web server in development mode, and a web server + remote repl in production. 
The build tool used in this project is [[http://boot-clj.com/][Boot]].
** Instructions
*** Development
 Start a repl: 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ boot repl
#+END_SRC
In the boot.user namespace, type: 
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure 
boot.user=> (go)
#+END_SRC
Your local web app can be found on [[http://localhost:300][localhost]] on port 3000.
*** Production
Package an uberjar:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ boot build
#+END_SRC

You are ready to launch:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ java -jar target/myproject-1.0.0.jar
#+END_SRC

Your web app will be found on port 8000, and on port 8001 you will be able to connect to its repl for remote debugging.
