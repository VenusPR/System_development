(defn new-handler
  "Creates a handler component. A handler component combines endpoints and
  middleware into a ring handler function.

  Endpoints should be added as dependencies using `component/using`, the names
  used for endpoints don't matter, they are recognized by their structure.

  Middleware can be added by depending on a middleware component, either
  per-endpoint, or once for the complete handler. Per-endpoint middleware can
  use any name, middleware on the handler must be called `:middleware`.

  The resulting ring handler function is available as `:handler` on the handler
  component.

  Example:

      (component/system-map
         :endpoint-a (new-endpoint some-routes)
         :endpoint-b (-> (new-endpoint other-routes)
                         (component/using [:endpoint-b-middleware]))
         :endpoint-b-middleware (new-middleware {:middleware [,,,]})
         :middleware (new-middleware {:middleware [,,,]})
         :handler (-> (new-handler)
                      (component/using [:endpoint :middleware]))
         :jetty (-> (new-web-server port)
                    (component/using [:handler])))"
